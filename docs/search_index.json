This near exponential growth enables and challenges effective research in the field of astronomy. Recently, we’ve seen more people adopting a data-driven revolution in astronomical research. Some say that for astronomy to cope with such advancements there is a need of information science specialists. Thus, promoting the growth of a new field Astroinformatics. It includes a set of naturally-related specialties such as data organization, description, classification taxonomies, concept ontologies, mining and of course machine learning and astrostatistics. Astroninformatics is the formalization of data-intensive astronomy and astrophysics for research and education 1.1.1 The Revolution The development of models to describe and understand scientific phenomena has historically proceeded at a pace driven by new data. The more data we have, the more we are driven to enhance / change our existing models. The acquisition of data in all scientific disciplines is rapidly accelerating and causing a nearly insurmountable data avalanche. Consequently, as growth in data volume accelerates, especially in the natural sciences, we as a community will fall further and further behind in our ability to access, analyze, assimilate, and assemble knowledge from our collections. In astronomy in particular rapid advances in areas such as telescopes, detectors and computation have continued unabated. With this accelerating advance in data generation capabilities over the coming years, we will require an increasingly skilled workforce in the areas of computational and data sciences in order to confront these challenges. Such skills are more critical than ever since modern science, which has always been data-driven, will become even more data-intensive in the coming decade. “There is a growing gap between the generation of data and our understanding of it” For instance in survey astronomy, the LSST (Large Synoptic Survey Telescope) will produce 3-Gigapixel image of the sky every 20 seconds, which corresponds to nearly 30 TB of data daily for 10 years. Even NASA acknowledges that previous approaches to scientific data management and analysis will simply not work. Within the scientific domain, data science is becoming a recognized academic discipline. Consequently, astronomy and other scientific disciplines are developing sub-disciplines that are information-rich and data-intensive to such an extent that these are now becoming (or have already become) recognized stand-alone research disciplines and full fledged academic programmes on their own merits. 1.1.2 What’s the Vision for Astroinformatics 🌌 Astroinformatics is often called as Discovery Informatics for astronomy. “Discovery Informatics is the study and practice of employing the full spectrum of computing and analytical science and technology to the singular pursuit of discovering new information by identifying and validation patterns in data” An informatics paradigm is needed within any data-intensive scientific discipline to make the best use of its rich data collections for scientific discovery. Discovery informatics thereby activates data integration and fusion across multiple heterogeneous data collections to enable scientific knowledge discovery and decision support. The experience of the other data-intensive sciences reveals that is imperative for the successful pursuit of data-intensive astronomy that astronomers work with computer scientists to design, develop, and deploy a similar set of common tools, data models, and ontologies. The database research community is responding to the data avalanche in astronomy, geosciences, and other disciplines. Researchers have started an international effort to create an open-source database technology called SciDB that is designed fundamentally to address extreme-scale science. SciDB’s design is inspired primarily by the needs of the LSST, with guidance from other disciplines. 1.1.3 Role of Machine Learning in Cosmology In recent years, machine learning (ML) methods have remarkably improved how cosmologists can interpret data. There are also new challenges for adopting ML methodologies and understanding the results. ML could possibly transform cosmology, but this transformation will require the astronomy community to both foster and promote interdisciplinary research endeavors. Nowadays Machine Learning has permeated our daily lives. The last decade has also seen a remarkable rise in interdisciplinary machine learning (ML) based astronomy research, offering enticing improvements in the ways in we can interpret data. Machine learning research explores the development and application of algorithms that find patterns in data. In the context of astronomy, ML algorithms can be used to address a broad range of tasks including (but not limited to):- Describing complicated relationships Identifying data clusters and data outliers Reducing Scatter by using complex or subtle signals Generating Simulated Data Classifying observations Addressing Sparse Data Exploring data sets to understand the physical underpinning Machine learning has already gained a lot of traction within the astronomy community, and compelling successful applications of ML indicate that it has the potential to be transformative. 1.1.4 Recent Success in Cosmology ML has shown to significantly reduce scatter in cluster mass estimates compared to more traditional methods. ML has been used with weak lensing maps to discriminate between standard and modified gravity models that generate statistically similar observations. ML has also shown to tighten parameter constraints by harnessing non-Gaussianities in these maps. ML has shown to provide competitive methods for signal to noise extraction of projected gravitation potentials from Cosmic Microwave background (CMB) experiments. ML models outperform traditional fast analytical approximations for predicting structure formation of the universe by generating full 3D N-body simulations. "],["possible-challenges.html", "1.2 Possible Challenges", " 1.2 Possible Challenges A common complaint about ML methods is that they are black boxes that cannot lead to physical understanding. But, there are ways to peer inside this box and to gain understanding. These include the recent developments in the field of interpretability. More advanced analyses of cosmological data place stringent requirements on the interpretability of results. This represents a key hurdle for applying ML to cosmology: the assessment of uncertainty and the removal of bias. Integrating traditional statistical methods with modern ML models may provide a solution, but this will require cross-disciplinary collaboration among statisticians, ML researchers, and cosmologists.

But if you think about it and think real hard, there are only a few fundamental questions in cosmology: Is the universe finite or infinite ? Has it existed forever ? If not, when and how did it come into being ? Will it ever end ? Where do Humans fit into the grand scheme of things ? Religion and Science both aim to answer these questions. According to Chinese creation myths the universe exists because a giant broke open a black egg, according the christian creation story it was Adam and Eve. For a long time it was assumed that we would never know the answers to the “big” questions and thus, cosmologists focused on the part of the universe that was directly observable and left the great mysteries to the philosophers 🤵 and theologians . "],["the-origins-of-scientific-cosmology.html", "2.2 The Origins of Scientific Cosmology 🌌", " 2.2 The Origins of Scientific Cosmology 🌌 Some say the idea that the universe can be rationally understood is at the foundation of all scientific knowledge. The history is quite exciting. At one side we had legends like Thales, Democritus and Epicurus who believed that matter (and living beings along with it) were made up of Fundamental particles and that we evolved due to random rearrangements without any set reason. Then we had Pythagoras who was the first one to call the heavens as cosmos, which mean order !!. He suggested that the Earth, the Sun, and the other celestial bodies are perfect spheres and move in perfect circles around a central fire, which cannot be seen by human eyes. Plato and Aristotle proposed more elaborate versions, saying that the earth was at the center, with the other bodies revolving around it about a center. Keep in mind this was a finite universe. Claudius Ptolemy gave his own model (The Geocentric model) using the concept of nested epicycles and retrogrades to account for the backward and forward motion of planets in the night sky. This model was followed for almost 1500 years !!! Figure 2.1: Ptolemaic Model Then around 16th century, Nicolaus Copernicus gave the heliocentric model which kept the Sun at the center and had the Earth and other celestial revolve in orbits. ( This idea was not taken well by the religious folk ) Figure 2.2: Copernecian Model The next breakthrough happened by the hands of Johannes Kepler under the mentorship of Tacho Brahe when he introduced the concept of elliptical orbits. Then ofcourse came Issac Newton who showed that we could derive the elliptical orbits of planets from his three laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation. "],["present-time-.html", "2.3 Present Time ⌚️", " 2.3 Present Time ⌚️ Despite it’s seemingly long history, Cosmology is a relatively young field. Most of the knowledge that we have comes from the data recorded in the last 100 years. We discovered that our Sun belongs to a huge disk-like conglomeration of about 3 hundered billion stars !!!, known as the Milky Way galaxy 🌌. Not only is the Sun merely one out of a hundred billion, our galaxy is one out of hundred billion other galaxies which are scattered throughout the observable universe. Edwin Hubble in 1929 showed that these all these galaxies aren’t really suspended. Rather, they are rushing away from each other at extremely high speeds. The Universe is expanding !!!. Now, if we extrapolate this expansion, backwards in time, we come to realize that the universe was once much denser and hotter. This is what’s called the Big Bang Theory. At the time of “creation”, all of space was filled with an extremely hot, dense condensed but still expaning “fireball ☄️” (of sorts). As it continued to expand, it eventually cooled leading to the formation of atoms, nuclei, stars, galaxies and then us ! In 1965 Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered a remnant of this primordial fireball ☄️. They found that the entire universe if bathed in a sea of low-intensity micro-waves, known as the Cosmic Microwave Background Radation (CMB). Thus, becoming a smoking gun 🔫 proof of big bang theory. The big bang theory, now has it’s roots in Albert Einstein’s , General Theory of Relativity. George Gamow introduce the idea of the early universe being hot. He argued that the hot primordial fireball was the furnace where all the present day chemical elements were forged. Gamow, along with Raplh Adler and Robert Herman successfully calculated the abundance of hydrogen and helium. In the 1980s and 90s, with the rise of astronomical data, the field emerged. Radio and optical astronomy flourished with computerized galaxy surveys and instruments like the Very Large Array (VLA) and the satellite Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE). The Hubble Space Telescope has captured images of galaxies so far away that it took much of the age of the universe for their light to reach us. The turn of the century saw the launch of the Williamson Microwave Anisotropy Probe(WMAP) satellite. We are truly living in the golden age of cosmology and astronomy. It may seem like observations have proven most questions, but the intriguing and in my opinion the most important questions, still remain. We’ve only just begun our journey from the microcosm to the macrocosm. "],["newtons-world.html", "Chapter 3 Newton’s World 🌎", " Chapter 3 Newton’s World 🌎 In the remarkable book Principia, Newton formulated the general laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation. He then went on to apply these laws to explain the motion of celestial bodies, projectiles and oceanic tides. "],["newtons-laws-of-motion-3-.html", "3.1 Newton’s Laws of Motion 3️⃣", " 3.1 Newton’s Laws of Motion 3️⃣ Newton’s First 1️⃣ law states that a body that is at rest will stay at rest, and a body that is moving with a constant velocity will maintain that constant velocity, unless it is acted upon by a force. This Law also goes by the name of The Law of Inertia. Newton’s Second 2️⃣law tells us that if a force is applied to a body, the body accelerates - meaning its velocity changes. The law can be stated mathematically as: \\[ \\vec{a} = \\frac{\\vec{F}}{m} \\] where, \\(\\vec{a}\\) is the acceleration of the body, \\(m\\) is its mass, and \\(\\vec{F}\\) is the applied force. The acceleration is defined as the rate at which the velocity changes. Newton’s Third 3️⃣ Law states that every action has a equal and opposite reaction. "],["newtonian-gravity.html", "3.2 Newtonian Gravity 🍎", " 3.2 Newtonian Gravity 🍎 Newton’s law of gravity states that any two objects are attracted to one another with a force: \\[F = \\frac{GMm}{r^2}\\] where \\(M\\) and \\(m\\) are the masses of the two objects and \\(r\\) is the distance between them. The force acting on mass \\(m\\) is directed towards the mass \\(M\\) and vice-versa. This also introduced Newton’s gravitational constant \\(G\\), \\[ G = 6.67 \\, \\times \\, 10^{-11} \\, Nm^2/kg^2 \\] Newton’s law of gravity is an “inverse square law”, because the gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two objects. The masses are assumed to be “point masses”; i.e., we assume that their sizes can be neglected, so we can imagine that each mass is located at a point. Furthermore, Newton proved the Shell Theorem, which states two important facts: A uniform spherical shell of matter attracts an outside object as if all of the shell’s mass were concentrated at its center. This applies to any uniform spherically symmetric object, like a solid sphere, since the object can be thought of as consisting of shells. The gravitational force exerted on an object that is inside a uniform spherical shell of matter is zero. "],["acceleration-of-free-fall.html", "3.3 Acceleration of Free Fall", " 3.3 Acceleration of Free Fall In everyday terms we often confuse weight and mass. When we get on a scale, we measure our weight — this is the force of gravity which pulls us towards the center of the Earth. For a small object of mass \\(m\\) near the surface of the Earth, the weight is given by \\[ F = \\frac{GM_Em}{r^{2}_{E}} \\] where \\(M_E = 6 \\, \\times \\, 10^{24} \\, kg\\) is the Earth’s mass, and \\(r_E = 6.4 \\, \\times \\, 10^6 m\\) is its radius. Now let’s consider what happens if we have an object of mass \\(m\\), close to the surface of the Earth, and we let it go. It will fall with acceleration \\(a = F/m\\), which becomes \\[ a = \\frac{GM_Em}{r^{2}_{E}} \\frac{1}{m} = \\frac{GM_E}{r^{2}_{E}} \\] This does not depend on the mass \\(m\\), which means that all bodies close to the surface of the Earth fall with the same acceleration, independent of their mass (as long as we ignore air resistance). "],["circular-motion-and-planetary-orbits.html", "3.4 Circular Motion and Planetary Orbits", " 3.4 Circular Motion and Planetary Orbits Figure 3.1: Uniform Circular Motion For uniform circular motion, the magnitude of the acceleration is: \\[ a = \\frac{v^2}{r} \\] where \\(v\\) is the speed of the object undergoing the motion and \\(r\\) is the radius of the circle. The direction of the acceleration is radially inward, towards the center of the circle and is called the centripetal acceleration. Newton showed in his Principia that the inverse square law implies that celestial bodies like planets and comets should move in elliptical orbits, in agreement with Kepler. While comets often move in highly eccentric orbits, for planets the two focal points of the ellipse almost coincide, so the orbit is approximately a circle. If the radius of the orbit is \\(r\\), its circumference is \\(2πr\\), and the velocity of the planet is \\[ v = \\frac{2πr}{T} \\] where \\(T\\) is the time it takes to complete one revolution. "],["newtonian-cosmology.html", "3.5 Newtonian Cosmology", " 3.5 Newtonian Cosmology Newton’s cosmological ideas developed during a correspondence with the Cambridge theologian Richard Bentley. Bentley was preparing to give public lectures titled “A confutation of atheism” and wrote to Newton asking him how his theory of gravity applied to the universe as a whole. During the winter of 1692–93, Newton sent a series of four letters to Bentley, in which he described a universe that is infinite and static: “The fixed stars, being equally spread out in all points of the heavens, cancel out their mutual pulls by opposite attractions.” Newton was acutely aware, there is a problem with this line of reasoning. If a region of the universe has a slight excess of matter, then that region will begin to attract material from its surroundings. Te region will become denser, and it will attract more and more matter. Thus a un- form distribution of stars is unstable due to gravity: it would be destroyed by an arbitrarily small perturbation. Newton’s solution was to invoke a super-natural intervention, stating “…this frame of things could not always subsist without a divine power to conserve it.”. "],["olbers-paradox.html", "3.6 Olbers’ Paradox", " 3.6 Olbers’ Paradox What do you think the Sun would look like if it were at twice its present distance from the Earth?? The total brightness of the Sun would be four times smaller because the brightness of an object decreases as the inverse square of the distance to the object. The area of the Sun’s disc on the sky would also be four times smaller. This means that the brightness per unit area (called the surface brightness) remains the same. So what? Well, in an infinite universe that is uniformly sprinkled with stars, every line of sight should eventually hit a star, and each star should have roughly the same surface brightness as the Sun. Thus implies that the whole sky should be glowing with the same intensity as the Sun’s surface. This is known as the Olbers’ Paradox or the Dark Night Sky Paradox. While Newton showed that his universal law of gravity could explain a vast scope of natural phenomena, he was at a loss to explain how it could be that the force of gravity acts instantaneously, between every pair of particles, across the vastness of space. At the end of his Principia, Newton conceded: “Thus far I have explained the phenomena of the heavens and our sea by the force of gravity, but I have not yet assigned a cause to gravity…. I have not as yet been able to deduce from phenomena the reason for these properties of gravity and I do not feign hypotheses,” but he then went on to declare “And it is enough that gravity really exists and acts according to the laws that we have set forth and is sufcient to explain all the motions of the heavenly bodies and of our sea.” Despite of Olbers’ Paradox and the problems of gravitational instability, Newtonian cosmology held sway for about 200 hundred years - until ofc Einstein’s general theory of relativity absolutely revolutionized   our understanding of gravity once again. "],["special-relativity.html", "Chapter 4 Special Relativity ", " Chapter 4 Special Relativity "],["the-principle-of-relativity.html", "4.1 The Principle of Relativity", " 4.1 The Principle of Relativity Although nowadays, the word “relativity” is synonymous with Albert Einstein, Galileo Galilei was actually the first scientist to formulate what we now call “the principle of relativity”. In his famous Dialogue (1632), Galileo suggested a mind experiment, that they should shut themselves up in the cabin of a ship, below the decks, so that they could see what was going on outside. He argued that they would not be able to tell whether the ship was stationary or moving, as long as the motion was uniform and in the same direction, without any turns. The choice of ship 🚢 was arbitrary, try imagining the same but in a train or a airplane. When the motion is smooth enough, and if you have closed your eyes, you would’ve noticed that you cannot tell whether you’re moving or not. Even rn, we are moving with the Earth around the Sun at a speed of 30 km/s, and with the entire Solar System around the galactic center at about 230 km/s. Even these velocities have no effect whatsoever on our daily tasks. Towards the end of the 19th century, a new problem emerged. The speed of light was measured to be around \\(300,000 \\, km/s\\). The problem was speed with respect to what ?? . When we say that the speed of sound is around \\(300 \\, m/s\\), it is understood that the sound propagates through the air to the observer from its source. Thus an observer, who is at rest with respect to the air, will measure this value for the speed of sound. Scientists assumed that for light this would be pretty much similar. Back then people believed that light propagated through something referred to as Ether. If we are at rest with respect to the ether, we should find that light propagates in all directions at the same speed of 300,000 km/s. But what if we are moving through the ether at a speed of, say, 100,000 km/s? Then a light pulse propagating in the same direction will only move at 200,000 km/s relative to us, while a pulse propagating in the opposite direction will speed away from us at 400,000 km/s.The speed of light in the directions orthogonal to our motion would remain unchanged at 300,000 km/s. Thus, in a space filled with ether, inertial observers who move at different speeds will no longer be equivalent. They will observe that the speed of light is direction-dependent, and they can use this to deduce their own speed with respect to the ether. An ingenious apparatus for measuring the difference between the speeds of light in two orthogonal directions was designed by Albert Michelson and Edward Morley. They knew that if our speed through the ether was as high as 100,000 km/s, then the direction-dependence of the speed of light would have been noticed in earlier experiments. Thus, Michelson and Morley expected to measure a much smaller number—which required a much higher accuracy. The result was startling . They detected no variation in the speed of light in different directions. To ensure that the Earth’s motion around the Sun at the time of the experiment was not accidentally compensated by the motion of the Solar System, they repeated the same experiment six months later. But again, no effect was found. The most logical and rather obvious conclusion suggested that the speed of light does not depend on the speed of the observer who measures it. This conflicted with Newtonian Physics and Common Sense. Thus, as most physicists just ignored the results. Well, the paradox was solved in 1905 by a 26 year old patent clerk from Bern. His name was Albert Einstein and He threw Newtonian Physics and Ether out of the window. "],["the-speed-of-light-and-electromagnetism.html", "4.2 The Speed of Light and Electromagnetism", " 4.2 The Speed of Light and Electromagnetism The two famous predictions from Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism are:- Oscillating electric and magnetic fields propagate through space as electromagnetic waves The speed of an electromagnetic wave is 300,000 km/s. Maxwell ofc realized this speed as the speed of light. He thus concluded that light must be a electromagnetic wave. The theory of light as an electromagnetic wave is a pillar of classical physics. However, in some circumstances, such as when light interacts with atoms, it is necessary to adopt the view of quantum physics. In this modern picture, we see a light wave is thought to be composed of huge number of photons that travel together.

This Galileo’s principle of relativity. The speed of light measured by all inertial observers is the same. The second postulate implies that there is no ether. Using just these 2 assumptions, Einstein led us to the: Relativity of Simultaneity. Time Dilation. Length Contraction. Mass-Energy Equivalence. "],["simultaneity.html", "4.4 Simultaneity", " 4.4 Simultaneity Now, let’s perform the famous Einstein Thought Experiment. Suppose Jane is standing in the middle of a moving train car, holding the switch of an overhead light bulb, which is initially turned of. Now she turns it on, and light propagates towards the front and back walls of the car. Since she is in the middle, light reaches the two walls at the same time. At least from her point of view. Now suppose Ben is observing this experiment standing on the platform. He sees Jane turn on the bulb, and light propagates in both directions at the same speed, which is of course the speed of light. But the back wall of the car is moving toward the approaching beam of light, while the front wall is moving away from the beam, so Ben will see light reach the back wall before it reaches the front wall. CONCLUSION: The simultaneity of events has no absolute meaning; it depends on the state of motion of the observer. "],["time-dilation.html", "4.5 Time Dilation", " 4.5 Time Dilation Figure 4.1: Time Dilation Now, let’s add on to the thought experiment by assuming that Jane (in the train with a speed \\(v\\)) is equipped with a light source, located at the floor of the her train car, and a mirror at a distance \\(L\\) directly above the source. By simply pushing a button, a light pulse is sent from the source to the mirror and back again. This round trip would take time \\(t_0 = 2L/c\\) (as measured by Jane). Now from Ben’s perspective, the light pulse travels along a diagonal path \\(D\\) which is longer than \\(L\\) and the time taken will be \\(t = 2D/c\\) for the pulse to complete the trip. Thus, the time interval between the same events is different when measured by different observers. In particular, they are related by the formula: \\[ t = \\gamma t_0\\] The relativistic factor \\(\\gamma\\) (also known as the Lorentz factor is defined as: \\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\\] This factor equals 1 when the relative velocity between two frames is zero. Figure 4.2: Lorentz factor as a function of velocity Consider this plot, as Jane turns on the engines and reverses the velocity of her train/ship, she is no longer an inertial observer, and thus the laws of special relativity do not apply in her reference frame.

Another important feature of the relativistic energy is that it tends to infinity when the velocity of an object approaches the speed of light. It takes increasingly large amounts of energy to bring the speed of the object closer and closer to the speed of light, but the limit \\(v = c\\) can never be reached. Thus, the speed of light is the absolute speed limit in the Universe "],["space-time-spacetime.html", "4.8 Space  Time ＝ SpaceTime", " 4.8 Space  Time ＝ SpaceTime It’s pretty easy to deduce that time is the 4th dimension. For instance, when we want to indicate a location in space we also add Time in it. For example: “Let’s meet at Starbucks” But when?? The complete statement should be: “Let’s meet at Starbucks tomorrow at 6 PM” When we combine such notions, we speak of spacetime. This is not acceptable in Newtonian Physics as space and time are completely independent. But as per Einstein’s theory it’s completely natural, infact space and time are routinely depicted together in spacetime diagrams. Let’s explore this by drawing an analogy with Euclidean geometry on a plane. Suppose we have two points on a plane that are connected by a straight line segment. We can characterize this segment by its projection on two orthogonal axes, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). The squared length of the segment remains equal irrespective of the axes. (Because of Pythagoras Theorem). Now compare this situation with Einstein’s theory. Given two events, their separations in space and time will differ for different observers. But this is only because the events are being projected on different space and time axes. Einstein’s former mathematics professor Minowski realized that all observers will agree on a specific quantity called the spacetime interval Consider two events A and B as per the fig. The square of the spacetime interval can then be expressed as: \\[ (\\Delta s)^2 = (c \\Delta t)^2 - (\\Delta x)^2\\] Since all inertial observers will agree on the value of the spacetime interval, we say that the spacetime interval is invariant "],["causality-in-spacetime.html", "4.9 Causality in Spacetime", " 4.9 Causality in Spacetime With space and time intervals varying from one observer to the next, it’s often easy to feel that physical reality is slipping away. Especially when you start thinking about the relation between cause and effect. Let’s assume that someone jumps at some time and place (Event A). Light propagates outwards along \\(45^o\\) lines. And as matter moves slower than light, the matter is confined to lie between the shaded region. Now, we can conclude that all observers will agree that all events in the shaded region are in the future of A. (Thus, it’s called the absolute future). Now, let’s think about all the events that can influence A. These are the events lying in the region absolute past. Also, the arbitrary event B can neither influence, nor be influenced by event A. For events in the absolute past of A, all observers will agree that they occurred earlier than A. However, for events like B that are not in the absolute future or past of A, observers will disagree: some of them will find that B is prior to A; others will find that it is later; and there will be some who will find that both events occurred at the same time. Thus, we can conclude that the time ordering of events can be reversed by going to another frame of reference only if the events are not causally related. Now, try imagining the same diagrams but in 3 dimensions. Then these regions would be converted into conical surfaces called light cones.

This inconsistency between the two theories is not difficult to illustrate. Newton’s theory states that the force between two bodies is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the bodies at an instant of time. But, according to Einstein, the distance (and the notion of “instant of time”), is not the same for different observers. Thus, arises the problem of which distance to use 🤔 🤔?? If Newton’s law is valid in the reference frame of some preferred inertial observer, while it is not valid for other inertial observers, then the principle of relativity is violated, because it requires that physical laws should apply equally to all inertial observers. So clearly, either Newton’s theory or relativity had to go … 😱 😱 "],["galileos-though-experiment.html", "5.1 Galileo’s though Experiment", " 5.1 Galileo’s though Experiment In his work Dialogue, Galileo argued that the motion of objects under the action of gravity is independent of their mass, size, or any other intrinsic properties, as long as air resistance and other non-gravitational forces can be neglected. This was contradictory to the accepted Aristotelian viewpoint at the time (Heavier objects fall faster). We know that Galileo experimented with marbles rolling down inclined planes and found that the motion was independent of the mass. He offered a proof on how Aristotle’s theory couldn’t be right: Suppose that indeed a heavy rock falls faster than a light rock. Now, Imagine that they are tied together with a very light string. The slower-moving light rock’s motion should make the motion of the heavier rock somewhat slower. But if we view both the rocks as a system, it’s combined mass is more than the heavy rock and should therefore fall faster. This contradiction demonstrated that Aristotle’s theory was inconsistent. NOTE: In the absence of forces, an object moves at a constant velocity along a straight line in spacetime, regardless of what the object is made of. It’s as if the object in space and time is a property of spacetime itself. Let’s take this analogy a bit further. Suppose that instead of a cabin, we lock ourselves in a falling elevator. All objects in the elevator and the elevator itself, will fall at the same rate. We will not be able to feel our weight because the floor itself is falling at the same rate. If we drop an object it will float next to us. The same kind of weightlessness is experienced in spaceships. The motion of objects in gravitational fields looks very similar to inertial motion. But, there’s a important difference. Gravity makes objects accelerate towards the Earth’s center, thus their wordlines are no longer straight. This led Einstein to conclude that in the presence of gravity, objects still move along the straightest lines in spacetime, but spacetime itself is curved. The idea is that massive bodies curve spacetime around them. For example, the spacetime in the vicinity of the Sun gets curved. Thus, the Earth does not move along a straight line at a constant velocity (as it would in the absence of any gravitating bodies), but instead it moves around the Sun. The Earth’s worldline is in fact the straightest line in this curved spacetime. (Such lines are also called geodesics). Note that a geodesic line in spacetime does not necessarily correspond to the straightest trajectory in space. For example, the Earth’s elliptic orbit around the Sun is certainly not the straightest possible path. "],["the-geometry-of-space.html", "5.2 The Geometry of Space", " 5.2 The Geometry of Space 5.2.1 Euclidean Geometry Our intuition about space and geometry is rooted in Euclidean geometry, which very accurately represents the properties of space - atleast on the scales familiar to humans. But let’s test the fifth axiom (“Given any straight line, you can draw one and only one straight line parallel to it through any point in the same plane.”) experimentally. First, we have to decide what we mean by a straight line. For the sake of argument, let’s choose light rays to be our standard straight lines. Then imagine shining two beams of light from two projectors onto a distant screen. If Euclid is right, then the distance between the two light spots on the screen should be equal to the distance between the projectors. But imagine that the light spots turn out to be slightly further apart, and that this distance keeps increasing as you move the screen further away. This would mean that the separation between the light beams grows with the distance. If our straight lines have this property of somehow “bending away” from one another, then it is not difficult to imagine that they can avoid intersection even if initially they are headed slightly towards each other. If light rays in our world had such properties, then perhaps we would not find Euclid’s fifth axiom so obvious. 5.2.2 Non-Euclidean Geometry The great German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss was the first to break away from the Euclidean dogma. In the early 1800s he explored a geometry in which the fifth axiom is replaced with a postulate allowing multiple parallel lines through the same point, and convinced himself that it was free from logical contradictions. He worked out the properties of various geometrical figures and found that they were in many ways different from those in the familiar Euclidean geometry. In particular, the sum of the angles in a triangle was always less than \\(180^o\\). This kind of geometry is now called hyperbolic geometry. Hyperbolic geometry was independently discovered in the 1820s by Nikolai Lobachevsky, a professor of mathematics in the provincial Russian city of Kazan, and a few years later by a Hungarian artillery officer Janos Bolyai. Hyperbolic geometry is now often called Lobachevsky geometry. "],["curved-space.html", "5.3 Curved Space", " 5.3 Curved Space Apart from his secret research on hyperbolic geometry, Gauss developed another, completely different approach to the problem. This work was even more important, because of its greater generality. 5.3.1 The Curvature of Surfaces Gauss’s key realization was that a surface could be regarded as a two-dimensional space in itself, as if the exterior world were non-existent. The role of a straight line connecting two points in that space is played by the geodesic line, which is the shortest line between two points along the surface. While a triangle on a flat surface has angles which sum to \\(180^o\\), this is not the case for a triangle made of three geodesic lines on a non-flat surface. Gauss found that for small triangles the deviation from \\(180^o\\) grows with the area of the triangle and is proportional to a quantity that he called the curvature of the 2D space. The curvature can be positive or negative, depending on whether the sum of the angles is greater or smaller than \\(180^o\\). A simple prototype of a curved surface is a sphere. The geodesic lines in this case are great circles. For example, meridians and the equatorial circle are geodesics on the globe. Any two great circles necessarily intersect - like all meridians intersect at the North and South poles. This means that parallel lines do not exist on a sphere, and thus Euclid’s fifth axiom does not hold. Also, triangles that are constructed from great circle segments, have angles which add to more than \\(180^o\\). Gauss found that the curvature of a sphere is inversely proportional to the square of its radius. As the radius is increased, the curvature gets smaller, and in the limit of infinite radius the curvature vanishes and the inner geometry is Euclidean. In this limit the sphere is indistinguishable from a plane. A 2D surface of negative curvature can be pictured as a saddle-like surface. The case of a sphere is rather special, because of its high symmetry. It is homogeneous, which means that no matter where you are on the sphere, it looks the same. It is also isotropic, which means that from any point on a sphere it looks the same in all directions. A homogeneous and isotropic 2D space of negative curvature is called a hyperboloid, and the inner geometry of that space is the hyperbolic geometry of Gauss and Lobachevsky. 5.3.2 The Curvature of 3D Space Of special interest are the homogeneous and isotropic 3D spaces in which all locations are equivalent, and which look the same in all directions. As in the case of two dimensions, there are only three types of such spaces: Euclidean, spherical and hyperbolic. Euclidean (or flat) space is the usual space we are most familiar with. It has zero curvature, and an infinite volume—it goes on and on ad infinitum. Spherical space (or the 3D sphere) is a three-dimensional analogue of a 2D spherical surface. It is a closed, finite space; its geodesics are circles of length \\(2πR\\), and its volume1 is \\(2π^2R^3\\). The parameter \\(R\\) is called the radius of the 3D sphere. The sum of angles in a triangle in this space is greater than \\(180^o\\). Also, as the radius of curvature R gets very large, the 3D curved space approaches 3D Euclidean space. A 3D hyperbolic space is a space of constant negative curvature. Its volume is infinite, and the sum of angles in a triangle is less than 180°. The area of a sphere grows faster than \\(r^2\\), so light sources get dimmer with distance even faster than they do in flat space. The 3D hyperbolic geometry is even harder to conceptualize than spherical curved geometry. "],["the-general-theory-of-relativity.html", "5.4 The General Theory of Relativity", " 5.4 The General Theory of Relativity It took Einstein five years to leap from Galileo’s cure to the idea of curved spacetime. He approached his old classmate Marcel Grossmann, a mathematician and an expert in geometry. After some time in the library, Grossmann reported back with some good news and some bad news. The good news was that the mathematics of curved spaces did exist. It had been developed by Bernhard Riemann, who extended Gauss’s work on the non-Euclidean geometry of curved surfaces to spaces of three and higher dimensions. The bad news was that this mathematics was an impenetrable mess. In the case of a surface, the curvature is characterized by a single number, while in higher dimensions it is described by a multi-component monster called the Riemann Tensor. The equations of the general theory of relativity, relate the geometry of spacetime to the material content of the Universe. \\[ R_{\\mu \\nu} - \\frac{1}{2}g_{\\mu \\nu}R = \\frac{8πG}{c^4}T_{\\mu \\nu} \\] This may look like a single equation, but the indices \\({\\mu}\\) and \\({\\nu}\\) take four possible values. LHS of the equation includes components of the Riemann tensor, which tells us how much the spacetime is curved in different directions. RHS contains Newton’s constant \\(G\\) and the so-called stress-energy tensor of matter \\(T_{\\mu \\nu}\\), whose components include the energy density, the energy flux, and pressure. The energy density is essentially the same thing as mass density, while the other quantities have little effect on gravity under normal circumstances. The energy flux is small when the speeds of gravitating bodies are well below the speed of light, and the pressure is normally much smaller than the energy density. An essential feature of Einstein’s theory is that gravitational effects propagate at the speed of light. Thus, the force of gravity is no longer determined by the instantaneous distance between the bodies. "],["predictions-and-tests-of-general-relativity.html", "5.5 Predictions and Tests of General Relativity", " 5.5 Predictions and Tests of General Relativity 5.5.1 Light Deflection and Gravitational Lensing The first new prediction of general relativity to be tested observationally was the defection of light as it propagates through a curved spacetime region near a massive body. If light from a distant star passes close to the Sun, the star should appear to be in a different position from where it usually is. Einstein proposed that a Solar eclipse would offer the perfect opportunity to view stars that appear close to the Sun. Their positions could then be measured and compared with their known positions when the Sun is not nearby. In 1919 two British teams led by Arthur Eddington set out to test Einstein’s prediction. Eddington’s announcement to the world that they had indeed measured the bending of starlight in complete agreement with Einstein’s theory, instantaneously turned Einstein into a household name. A related prediction is that of gravitational lensing: light from a distant source is bent as it passes by a massive object, like a galaxy, resulting in multiple images of the same source. If the lensing galaxy happens to be centered on the line of sight to the source, the images are spread into a circular band known as an Einstein ring. 5.5.2 Gravitational Waves Another key prediction of general relativity is that accelerating massive bodies generate small distortions (or ripples) in the geometry of spacetime, called gravitational waves, that travel at the speed of light, much like accelerated charges generate electromagnetic waves. Gravitational waves interact very weakly with matter and are therefore extremely hard to detect. Nonetheless, indirect evidence for gravitational waves has been known for some time. General relativity predicts that as two stars orbit one another, they release energy in the form of gravitational waves. This loss of energy causes the stars to spiral in towards one another, which increase their orbital speed, and decreases their orbital period. In 1974, a spiraling binary pair consisting of two neutron stars was detected. Over the last few decades, the orbital period of the pair has changed in the precise way predicted by general relativity. In September 2015, gravitational waves were directly detected using both of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors located in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington, USA. The LIGO detectors were able to measure the distortion of spacetime caused by gravitational waves that emanated from a coalescing pair of black holes. Scientists deduced that 29 and 36 Solar mass black holes collided to form a larger spinning black hole. The collision occurred about 1.3 billion years ago, lasted for a fraction of a second, and converted about 3 Solar masses of energy into gravitational wave radiation, some of which passed through the Earth. The spatial distortion caused by gravitational waves is almost imperceptibly small: each LIGO instrument has two arms that are about 4 km long, and changes in its length of about one ten thousandth the size of a proton are measurable. It is a huge experimental triumph to be able to measure such a minute change in the apparatus, and to be able to deduce so much about the nature of the system which generated the gravitational radiation. "],["an-expanding-universe.html", "Chapter 6 An Expanding Universe 🌌 ", " Chapter 6 An Expanding Universe 🌌 "],["einsteins-static-universe.html", "6.1 Einstein’s Static Universe", " 6.1 Einstein’s Static Universe Shortly after completing the general theory of relativity, Einstein went on to apply his new theory to the universe as a whole !! The structure of the universe beyond our Milky Way galaxy was then completely unknown, thus Einstein made some assumptions. Einstein assumed that the universe is isotropic on average. (It looks more or less the same in all directions). We now know that if the distribution of galaxies is smoothed over distances of 300 million light years or so, it does appear to be homogeneous and isotropic. The universe cannot be homogeneous and isotropic unless space itself has these properties and thus, the curvature of space should be (on average) the same at all places and in all directions. As discussed earlier there are only 3 types of such spaces: a flat Euclidean space, a closed spherical space, and an open hyperbolic space. Einstein also assumed that the average characteristics of the universe, such as the average density of stars, do not change with time. But as it turns out the equations of General Relativity have no solutions with these properties. The problem is that masses distributed in the universe are pulled together by gravity and refuse to stay at rest. The theory was suggesting that the universe couldn’t be static. Einstein said that the equations for General Relativity had to be modified to endow vacuum. As per these modified equations the energy density \\(\\rho_{\\nu}\\) is constant everywhere (Einstein called it the cosomological constant). The vacuum pressure \\(P_{\\nu}\\) is related to the vacuum every density as: \\[ P_{\\nu} = \\rho_{\\nu} \\] Negative pressure is commonly referred to as tension. So if the vacuum has tension why doesn’t it suck everything in ? The Reason being in order to produce a force, we need a difference in pressure. The vacuum pressure is same everywhere and thus we should not expect any shrinkage (or expansion). The force of gravity in General Relativity depends both on the energy( or mass ) density. It is proportional to: \\[ \\rho + 3P \\] For ordinary matter, pressure is negligible, so we are used to thinking about gravity as being dependent only on mass. However, for the vacuum, the pressure has the same magnitude as the energy density. Thus, we find that the gravitational force of the vacuum is proportional to: \\[ \\rho_{\\nu} + 3P_{\\nu} = -2 \\rho_{\\nu} \\] Einstein realized that by adding a cosmological constant to his equations, he could balance the gravitational attraction of matter with the gravitational repulsion of the vacuum. All he needed was a matter density with \\(\\rho_m = 2 \\rho_{\\nu}\\), to balance the gravitational effect of vacuum. He thereby obtained a solution that describes a static universe. This solution has a closed, spherical geometry, with the radius determined by the matter density. For the density given by recent measurements, the corresponding circumference is about 100 billion light years. "],["problems-with-a-static-universe.html", "6.2 Problems with a Static Universe", " 6.2 Problems with a Static Universe Despite the appeal of a static universe, it turns out that Einstein’s static cosmological model is not acceptable. To see why, let’s think about what would happen if the radius of the universe were slightly decreased. Well the matter density \\(\\rho_m\\) would increase and \\(\\rho_{\\nu}\\) by definition would remain constant. Thus, the balance is tipped and the Universe begins to contract and actually accelerates as the matter density is further decreased. Similarly, one can easily deduce that if the radius of the universe were to increase, we’d have a expanding universe. Small fluctuations in the radius of the universe cannot be avoided, and thus Einstein’s universe cannot remain static for long. Another problem with the theory is that it conflicts with one of the most universal laws of nature - the second law of thermodynamics which states that an isolated physical system evolves from more ordered to more disordered states. A book sliding along the floor comes to a halt due to friction, and the energy of its directed, ordered motion turns into heat, i.e., into the energy of the disordered motion of molecules. The inverse process would be for the book to cool down and start moving along the floor. The universe can be regarded as an isolated system. Therefore, if it existed forever, thermal equilibrium would have been reached. The stars would have completely burnt out, cooling to the same temperature as interstellar space, and no life would be possible. "],["friedmanns-expanding-universe.html", "6.3 Friedmann’s Expanding Universe", " 6.3 Friedmann’s Expanding Universe The next breakthrough development in cosmology occurred in a rather unlikely place - the Soviet Petrograd, devastated by war and the Russian revolution. Once Alexander Friedmann studied the theory of General Relativity, he adopted Einstein’s assumptions that the universe was homogeneous and isotropic and that it had a closed spherical geometry. But then he took a rather radical step: he did not require that the universe is static. With the requirement of a static universe lifted, Friedmann found that Einstein’s equations did have a solution. The solution described a spherical universe with a time-varying radius and density. It starts with zero radius, expands, comes to a halt, and then contracts back to size zero. If you were an observer living in some galaxy in such a universe, then during the expansion phase, you would see all the other galaxies moving away from your galaxy, whilst during contraction all galaxies would approach you. To understood how such a thing is possible consider the surface of a balloon, which is a good 2D analogy to a 3D closed spherical geometry. Imagine that small dots, representing galaxies, are painted on the balloon. As the balloon is inflated, all the dots move away from each other as their relative distances increase. Conversely, as the balloon is deflated, all the dots get closer to each other. It doesn’t matter which dot we focus on, the view is the same. The history of an evolving closed universe in this encapsulated in the above space-time diagram. Here, time runs from the bottom up and horizontal circles represent instantaneous snapshots of the universe. The initial and final moments were later named, as the Big Bang and the Big Crunch. At these moments, all matter is compressed into an infinitesimal volume, so the density is infinite. This makes Einstein’s equations mathematically ill defined, so the spacetime cannot be extended beyond these points. Such points are called spacetime singularities. According to Friedmann’s solution, shortly after the big bang, the expansion of the universe is very fast. Then it slowed down by the gravitational attraction between galaxies, and eventually comes to a halt, followed by contraction. This is similar to the motion of a projectile launched vertically upwards. Friedmann presented his solution in a paper that was published in 1922 in a German physics journal. Two years later, he published a follow-up paper describing an infinite (open) homogeneous and isotropic universe with hyperbolic geometry. Once again, he found that such a universe expands from a singularity of infinite matter density. The expansion slows down initially but it never stops completely, with galaxies approaching constant recession speeds at late times. The borderline case between open and closed solutions is a “flat” universe, having Euclidean geometry. Such a universe expands forever, but at ever decreasing speed, like a projectile launched at exactly the escape velocity. A 2D analogue for an expanding flat universe is a flat rubber sheet that is being uniformly stretched in both directions. The distances between all “galaxies” are then stretched by the same factor. The sheet can be arbitrarily large, and we can imagine it to be infinite. The problem of Closed vs Open universe models was solved in 1929, when Edwin Hubble made what was arguably the most unexpected discovery in the history of science. As for Einstein, he reportedly quipped that adding the cosmological constant to his equation was the greatest blunder of my life. But even though the cosmological constant fell out of favor after the expansion of the universe was observed, it has since returned to the forefront of physics research. "],["observational-cosmology.html", "Chapter 7 Observational Cosmology 🌌", " Chapter 7 Observational Cosmology 🌌 Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake for his heretical ideas in 1600. He believed that the stars like our Sun and appear to be dimmer only because of their great distance from us. Now, Issac Newton thought that there was a distinction between the lucid matter of the stars and the opague nature of the Earth and the planets. In a letter to Richard Bently, where he discussed the creation of the Solar System amongst other things, Newton wrote: “But how the matter should divide itself into two sorts, and that part of it which is to compose a shining body should fall down into one mass and make a sun and the rest which is to fit to compose an opaque body should coalesce, not into one great body, but into many little ones ….” Newton resorted to divine intervention to explain the separation of the Solar System into the sun and planets. But, spectroscopic experiments in the mid 1800s revealed that the Sun and the stars are actually made of the same chemical elements as the Earth and the planets. !! "],["fingerprints-of-the-elements-.html", "7.1 Fingerprints of the Elements ☝️", " 7.1 Fingerprints of the Elements ☝️ When a beam of white light is shone through a prism, it emerges on the other side having a continuum of colors. This continuum spectrum shows that white light is composed of many colors, ranging from red to violet. Light emitted from a hot gas that is incident on a prism displays an emission line spectrum - a pattern of bright lines with particular wavelengths can be seen on a black background. Another interesting phenomenon occurs when a beam of white light is passed through cool gas before it gets to the prism. Te gas absorbs waves having some specific wavelengths, and a pat- tern of black lines, called absorption lines, appears in the spectrum. The pattern of both emission and absorption lines depends on the composition of the gas. Atoms of a given chemical element can emit and absorb light only at a particular set of wavelengths,so the emission or absorption line spectrum provides a unique “fingerprint ☝️” for each element. Light that emanates from the hot inner parts of a star has a continuum spectrum that develops absorption lines as it passes through the cooler stellar atmosphere. Astronomers measure the spectra of stars, and by comparing with the absorption lines of gases measured in the laboratory, they can identify whether elements such as hydrogen, helium, carbon, etc., are present in the star. "],["measuring-velocities.html", "7.2 Measuring Velocities 💫", " 7.2 Measuring Velocities 💫 For nearby stars, like Barnard’s star, we can directly calculate how fast the star is moving in a direction orthogonal to the line of sight. We do so by measuring the star’s displacement on photographic plates taken some time apart. However, more distant stars are so far away that it is impossible to detect their motion and measure their velocities using this method. Te observed wavelength (color) of light depends on the relative motion of the source and the observer. If a source of light is moving towards us, the observed wavelength gets shorter—that is, it shifts towards the blue end of the spectrum. Conversely, if a source is moving away from us, the observed wavelength will get longer, shifting towards the red end of the spectrum. We say the source is blue- or redshifted. This phenomenon, known as the Doppler effect, occurs for all kinds of waves, including sound waves and ripples on the surface of water. Quantitatively, the Doppler effect for light can be expressed by a simple formula: \\[ \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda} = \\frac{v}{c} \\] The redshift \\(z\\) is defined as: \\[ z = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda} \\] For a moving star, the entire spectrum gets blue- or redshifted, including the black absorption lines. Astronomers identify line patterns of diferent elements and measure how much these patterns are shifted relative to a sample at rest in the laboratory. "],["measuring-distances.html", "7.3 Measuring Distances", " 7.3 Measuring Distances Te determination of distances to astronomical objects is notoriously difficult and has dominated much of twentieth century astronomy. Today astronomers use a variety of techniques to measure distances—each one is most useful within a given range. Distances to nearby stars can be found by measuring their parallax, which is the apparent movement of the star relative to the background sky as the Earth rotates around the Sun. Te parallax is used to define an astronomical unit of distance, called a parsec (pc). One parsec is the distance at which a star would have a parallax of 1′′; it is equal to about 3.3 light years. While 100 light years seems like a large distance, our nearby neighbor, The Andromeda galaxy, is 2.5 million light years away. So parallax measurements can be seen as a first rung in what we call the cosmic distance ladder. Astronomers use a variety of so called standard candles to extend the reach of our distance measurements. Although none of them is perfect, they all work on the following premise: if we know how intrinsically luminous a light source is, and we measure how bright it appears, we can figure out how far away it is. Te key relation is that the brightness of a light source decreases with the square of its distance, \\[ b = \\frac{L}{4\\pi d^2} \\] Today astronomers use extremely powerful stellar explosions, called supernovae, as standard candles. Although there are many kinds of supernovae, with differing properties, Type 1a supernovae have very uniform luminosities. The physics of Type 1a supernovae is not yet fully understood, but the most plausible cause is a thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf star. There appear to be two mechanisms to trigger the explosion. If a white dwarf has a companion star, from which it can accrete material, it may gain so much mass that gravity overwhelms the pressure forces, and the white dwarf starts to collapse. This ignites a runaway thermonuclear reaction, and the white dwarf star is completely blown away. A Collision of two white dwarfs. When the two stars merge, their combined mass exceeds the stability threshold, and once again this leads to collapse. By measuring the apparent brightness of such supernovae and knowing the luminosity, the distance to the host galaxy can be determined. These powerful beacons have allowed astronomers to chart the universe out to billions of light years.

There were two rival theories about the nature of nebulae: There was nothing but empty space beyond our galaxy. Nebulae were objects within the galaxy, probably sites of star formation. Nebulae were “island universes” in their own right, similar to our Galaxy. This contentious question resulted in “The Great Debate” between Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, held in 1920 at the Museum of Natural History in Washington. Although the debate ended inconclusively it was resolved in 1923, when Edwin Hubble established that the nebulae were other island universities, completely separate from our Galaxy. Hubble identified Cepheid variable stars in Andromeda and several other nebulae. Using Leavitt’s period-luminosity relation, he was then able to determine the distances to these nebulae. Today we know that Andromeda is about 2.5 million light years away—roughly 50 times the radius of the Milky Way. Hubble’s initial estimate of 1.5 million light years was significantly lower. However, it was still large enough to show that the nebulae must include billions of stars; and that they are indeed “island universes” similar to our own Galaxy. We now call them galaxies. "]]
