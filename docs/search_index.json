"],["the-big-cosmic-questions.html", "2.1 The Big Cosmic Questions ", " 2.1 The Big Cosmic Questions  Cosmological practitioners strive to describe cosmic history in quantitative detail, using the language of modern physics and abstract mathematics. But if you think about it and think real hard, there are only a few fundamental questions in cosmology: Is the universe finite or infinite ? Has it existed forever ? If not, when and how did it come into being ? Will it ever end ? Where do Humans fit into the grand scheme of things ? Religion and Science both aim to answer these questions. According to Chinese creation myths the universe exists because a giant broke open a black egg, according the christian creation story it was Adam and Eve. For a long time it was assumed that we would never know the answers to the “big” questions and thus, cosmologists focused on the part of the universe that was directly observable and left the great mysteries to the philosophers 🤵 and theologians . "],["the-origins-of-scientific-cosmology.html", "2.2 The Origins of Scientific Cosmology 🌌", " 2.2 The Origins of Scientific Cosmology 🌌 Some say the idea that the universe can be rationally understood is at the foundation of all scientific knowledge. The history is quite exciting. At one side we had legends like Thales, Democritus and Epicurus who believed that matter (and living beings along with it) were made up of Fundamental particles and that we evolved due to random rearrangements without any set reason. Then we had Pythagoras who was the first one to call the heavens as cosmos, which mean order !!. He suggested that the Earth, the Sun, and the other celestial bodies are perfect spheres and move in perfect circles around a central fire, which cannot be seen by human eyes. Plato and Aristotle proposed more elaborate versions, saying that the earth was at the center, with the other bodies revolving around it about a center. Keep in mind this was a finite universe. Claudius Ptolemy gave his own model (The Geocentric model) using the concept of nested epicycles and retrogrades to account for the backward and forward motion of planets in the night sky. This model was followed for almost 1500 years !!! Figure 2.1: Ptolemaic Model Then around 16th century, Nicolaus Copernicus gave the heliocentric model which kept the Sun at the center and had the Earth and other celestial revolve in orbits. ( This idea was not taken well by the religious folk ) Figure 2.2: Copernecian Model The next breakthrough happened by the hands of Johannes Kepler under the mentorship of Tacho Brahe when he introduced the concept of elliptical orbits. Then ofcourse came Issac Newton who showed that we could derive the elliptical orbits of planets from his three laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation. "],["present-time-.html", "2.3 Present Time ⌚️", " 2.3 Present Time ⌚️ Despite it’s seemingly long history, Cosmology is a relatively young field. Most of the knowledge that we have comes from the data recorded in the last 100 years. We discovered that our Sun belongs to a huge disk-like conglomeration of about 3 hundered billion stars !!!, known as the Milky Way galaxy 🌌. Not only is the Sun merely one out of a hundred billion, our galaxy is one out of hundred billion other galaxies which are scattered throughout the observable universe. Edwin Hubble in 1929 showed that these all these galaxies aren’t really suspended. Rather, they are rushing away from each other at extremely high speeds. The Universe is expanding !!!. Now, if we extrapolate this expansion, backwards in time, we come to realize that the universe was once much denser and hotter. This is what’s called the Big Bang Theory. At the time of “creation”, all of space was filled with an extremely hot, dense condensed but still expaning “fireball ☄️” (of sorts). As it continued to expand, it eventually cooled leading to the formation of atoms, nuclei, stars, galaxies and then us ! In 1965 Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered a remnant of this primordial fireball ☄️. They found that the entire universe if bathed in a sea of low-intensity micro-waves, known as the Cosmic Microwave Background Radation (CMB). Thus, becoming a smoking gun 🔫 proof of big bang theory. The big bang theory, now has it’s roots in Albert Einstein’s , General Theory of Relativity. George Gamow introduce the idea of the early universe being hot. He argued that the hot primordial fireball was the furnace where all the present day chemical elements were forged. Gamow, along with Raplh Adler and Robert Herman successfully calculated the abundance of hydrogen and helium. In the 1980s and 90s, with the rise of astronomical data, the field emerged. Radio and optical astronomy flourished with computerized galaxy surveys and instruments like the Very Large Array (VLA) and the satellite Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE). The Hubble Space Telescope has captured images of galaxies so far away that it took much of the age of the universe for their light to reach us. The turn of the century saw the launch of the Williamson Microwave Anisotropy Probe(WMAP) satellite. We are truly living in the golden age of cosmology and astronomy. It may seem like observations have proven most questions, but the intriguing and in my opinion the most important questions, still remain. We’ve only just begun our journey from the microcosm to the macrocosm. "],["newtons-world.html", "Chapter 3 Newton’s World 🌎", " Chapter 3 Newton’s World 🌎 In the remarkable book Principia, Newton formulated the general laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation. He then went on to apply these laws to explain the motion of celestial bodies, projectiles and oceanic tides. "],["newtons-laws-of-motion-3-.html", "3.1 Newton’s Laws of Motion 3️⃣", " 3.1 Newton’s Laws of Motion 3️⃣ Newton’s First 1️⃣ law states that a body that is at rest will stay at rest, and a body that is moving with a constant velocity will maintain that constant velocity, unless it is acted upon by a force. This Law also goes by the name of The Law of Inertia. Newton’s Second 2️⃣law tells us that if a force is applied to a body, the body accelerates - meaning its velocity changes. The law can be stated mathematically as: \\[ \\vec{a} = \\frac{\\vec{F}}{m} \\] where, \\(\\vec{a}\\) is the acceleration of the body, \\(m\\) is its mass, and \\(\\vec{F}\\) is the applied force. The acceleration is defined as the rate at which the velocity changes. Newton’s Third 3️⃣ Law states that every action has a equal and opposite reaction. "],["newtonian-gravity.html", "3.2 Newtonian Gravity 🍎", " 3.2 Newtonian Gravity 🍎 Newton’s law of gravity states that any two objects are attracted to one another with a force: \\[F = \\frac{GMm}{r^2}\\] where \\(M\\) and \\(m\\) are the masses of the two objects and \\(r\\) is the distance between them. The force acting on mass \\(m\\) is directed towards the mass \\(M\\) and vice-versa. This also introduced Newton’s gravitational constant \\(G\\), \\[ G = 6.67 \\, \\times \\, 10^{-11} \\, Nm^2/kg^2 \\] Newton’s law of gravity is an “inverse square law”, because the gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two objects. The masses are assumed to be “point masses”; i.e., we assume that their sizes can be neglected, so we can imagine that each mass is located at a point. Furthermore, Newton proved the Shell Theorem, which states two important facts: A uniform spherical shell of matter attracts an outside object as if all of the shell’s mass were concentrated at its center. This applies to any uniform spherically symmetric object, like a solid sphere, since the object can be thought of as consisting of shells. The gravitational force exerted on an object that is inside a uniform spherical shell of matter is zero. "],["acceleration-of-free-fall.html", "3.3 Acceleration of Free Fall", " 3.3 Acceleration of Free Fall In everyday terms we often confuse weight and mass. When we get on a scale, we measure our weight — this is the force of gravity which pulls us towards the center of the Earth. For a small object of mass \\(m\\) near the surface of the Earth, the weight is given by \\[ F = \\frac{GM_Em}{r^{2}_{E}} \\] where \\(M_E = 6 \\, \\times \\, 10^{24} \\, kg\\) is the Earth’s mass, and \\(r_E = 6.4 \\, \\times \\, 10^6 m\\) is its radius. Now let’s consider what happens if we have an object of mass \\(m\\), close to the surface of the Earth, and we let it go. It will fall with acceleration \\(a = F/m\\), which becomes \\[ a = \\frac{GM_Em}{r^{2}_{E}} \\frac{1}{m} = \\frac{GM_E}{r^{2}_{E}} \\] This does not depend on the mass \\(m\\), which means that all bodies close to the surface of the Earth fall with the same acceleration, independent of their mass (as long as we ignore air resistance). "],["circular-motion-and-planetary-orbits.html", "3.4 Circular Motion and Planetary Orbits", " 3.4 Circular Motion and Planetary Orbits Figure 3.1: Uniform Circular Motion For uniform circular motion, the magnitude of the acceleration is: \\[ a = \\frac{v^2}{r} \\] where \\(v\\) is the speed of the object undergoing the motion and \\(r\\) is the radius of the circle. The direction of the acceleration is radially inward, towards the center of the circle and is called the centripetal acceleration. Newton showed in his Principia that the inverse square law implies that celestial bodies like planets and comets should move in elliptical orbits, in agreement with Kepler. While comets often move in highly eccentric orbits, for planets the two focal points of the ellipse almost coincide, so the orbit is approximately a circle. If the radius of the orbit is \\(r\\), its circumference is \\(2πr\\), and the velocity of the planet is \\[ v = \\frac{2πr}{T} \\] where \\(T\\) is the time it takes to complete one revolution. "],["newtonian-cosmology.html", "3.5 Newtonian Cosmology", " 3.5 Newtonian Cosmology Newton’s cosmological ideas developed during a correspondence with the Cambridge theologian Richard Bentley. Bentley was preparing to give public lectures titled “A confutation of atheism” and wrote to Newton asking him how his theory of gravity applied to the universe as a whole. During the winter of 1692–93, Newton sent a series of four letters to Bentley, in which he described a universe that is infinite and static: “The fixed stars, being equally spread out in all points of the heavens, cancel out their mutual pulls by opposite attractions.” Newton was acutely aware, there is a problem with this line of reasoning. If a region of the universe has a slight excess of matter, then that region will begin to attract material from its surroundings. Te region will become denser, and it will attract more and more matter. Thus a un- form distribution of stars is unstable due to gravity: it would be destroyed by an arbitrarily small perturbation. Newton’s solution was to invoke a super-natural intervention, stating “…this frame of things could not always subsist without a divine power to conserve it.”. "],["olbers-paradox.html", "3.6 Olbers’ Paradox", " 3.6 Olbers’ Paradox What do you think the Sun would look like if it were at twice its present distance from the Earth?? The total brightness of the Sun would be four times smaller because the brightness of an object decreases as the inverse square of the distance to the object. The area of the Sun’s disc on the sky would also be four times smaller. This means that the brightness per unit area (called the surface brightness) remains the same. So what? Well, in an infinite universe that is uniformly sprinkled with stars, every line of sight should eventually hit a star, and each star should have roughly the same surface brightness as the Sun. Thus implies that the whole sky should be glowing with the same intensity as the Sun’s surface. This is known as the Olbers’ Paradox or the Dark Night Sky Paradox. While Newton showed that his universal law of gravity could explain a vast scope of natural phenomena, he was at a loss to explain how it could be that the force of gravity acts instantaneously, between every pair of particles, across the vastness of space. At the end of his Principia, Newton conceded: “Thus far I have explained the phenomena of the heavens and our sea by the force of gravity, but I have not yet assigned a cause to gravity…. I have not as yet been able to deduce from phenomena the reason for these properties of gravity and I do not feign hypotheses,” but he then went on to declare “And it is enough that gravity really exists and acts according to the laws that we have set forth and is sufcient to explain all the motions of the heavenly bodies and of our sea.” Despite of Olbers’ Paradox and the problems of gravitational instability, Newtonian cosmology held sway for about 200 hundred years - until ofc Einstein’s general theory of relativity absolutely revolutionized   our understanding of gravity once again.
